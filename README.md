# My Social Media Post Scheduler

Because I am lazy bum!

Use case:

I am a developer circle community lead and I would like to automate posts rather than to post everyday. Of course there are tools that I can pay to use to perform this task, but we are in a pandemic and I want to save every coin I can.

This is also my opportunity to learn how to set up Redis, ElasticSearch, AWS and RabbitMQ.

- LinkedIn using LinkedIn API
- Facebook using Facebook API
- Twitter using Twitter API

Technologies used:

- python/django
- vue js 
- postgres db
- Rabbit mq
- docker
- ElasticSearch
- Redis

hosted on:
