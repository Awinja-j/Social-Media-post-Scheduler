## The Scheduling Engine

### How is works

It uses the python package `schedule` 


[schedule](https://pypi.org/project/schedule/) is an in-process scheduler for periodic jobs that uses the builder pattern for configuration. Schedule lets you run Python functions (or any other callable) periodically at predetermined intervals using a simple, human-friendly syntax.

Each Schedule is setup when a new post is added to the system.
