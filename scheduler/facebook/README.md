# Setup your Facebook

This setup gets your user_id and uses it to access all the groups and pages you are involved in.

## Get the Access Token

To be able to extract data from Facebook using a python code you need to register as a developer on Facebook and then have an access token. 
Here are the steps for it.
1. Go to link developers.facebook.com, create an account there.
2. Go to link developers.facebook.com/tools/explorer.
3. Go to “My apps” drop down in the top right corner and select “add a new app”. Choose a display name and a category and then “Create App ID”.
4. Again get back to the same link developers.facebook.com/tools/explorer. You will see “Graph API Explorer” below “My Apps” in the top right corner. From “Graph API Explorer” drop down, select your app.
5. Then, select “Get Token”. From this drop down, select “Get User Access Token”. Select permissions from the menu that appears and then select “Get Access Token.”
6. Go to link developers.facebook.com/tools/accesstoken. Select “Debug” corresponding to “User Token”. Go to “Extend Token Access”. This will ensure that your token does not expire every two hours.
